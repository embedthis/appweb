Test SSL/TLS certificate generation for Embedthis Appweb.

**WARNING: All certificates are for testing only — never use in production.**

## Building

```bash
make                    # Generate all test certificates
make build              # Same as above
make ca-cert            # Generate CA certificate (ca.crt, ca.key)
make self-signed-cert   # Generate self-signed certificate (self.crt, self.key)
make test-cert          # Generate CA-signed test certificate (test.crt, test.key)
make ec-cert            # Generate EC certificate (ec.crt, ec.key)
make cert-request       # Generate CSR for external CA (server.csr, server.key)
make show-certs         # Display all certificate details
make roots              # Download Mozilla root CA bundle
make package            # Copy distributable files to dist/
make cache              # Build, package and cache
make clean              # Remove all generated files
```
