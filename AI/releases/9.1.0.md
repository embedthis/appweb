# Appweb 9.1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 3, 2025

## Overview

Appweb 9.1.0 is a **recommended upgrade** maintenance release focusing on security hardening, test infrastructure modernization, and documentation improvements. This release incorporates the results of an extensive security audit using static analysis tools, fuzzing, and AI-supported scanning. While no security issues with relevant risk were discovered, the update significantly tightens the codebase in many places.

This release maintains full API compatibility with Appweb 9.0.x while improving security posture and the development experience.

**Important:** Appweb remains in maintenance mode with ongoing security updates and critical bug fixes. For new projects, consider migrating to [Ioto Device Agent](https://www.embedthis.com/ioto/).
